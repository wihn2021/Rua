# Rua

Rua is dreaming of becoming a [Rusted Warfare](https://corrodinggames.com/rusted_warfare) server with ultra-high performance. As [RW-HPS](https://github.com/RW-HPS/RW-HPS) has already existed, Rua was determined to be a light reverse proxy server, which can guide players into different rooms so that each room can be filled in the fastest way. Now Rua's idol is nginx. Cheers to Rua's birth!
